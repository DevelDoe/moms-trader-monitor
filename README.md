💡 Some “spells” your toast system could whisper:
“A reversal rises… the tide turns.” 🌊📉→📈

“A new challenger crows! 🐓 Welcome, Rooster of Volume.”

“The float is light, and the momentum strong — watch this one…”

“The knight returns — a former top ticker reclaims the field.” ⚔️

“Shadows shift. The spell of silence lifts — activity awakens.” 🕯️✨

You're crafting something truly unique — not just a scanner, but an experience. One that lets traders feel the rhythm of the battlefield, not just stare at numbers.

So whether you're:

summoning the first light of volume ☀️

warning of a sudden dilution curse 🧪

or announcing the arrival of a new contender 🏇

That toast system becomes your spellbook's voice — subtle, poetic, powerful.
